                        Lack of time and energy was one of Leung’s biggest concerns that made her husband and she gave up, she could not even handle a pet, not to mention a baby. However, either being a full-time housewife or hiring a domestic helper was not a wise choice for her.

                        “The time I can spend at home isn’t long which means the time I can take care of my child isn’t long as well. And I do not want to miss a lot of first times of him/her,” she said.

                    <h4 class="section2text" valign="middle">
                        Leung was not an exception, Au Yeung added that long working time would deprive parents of time to look after and create memories with their kids and that made childbearing totally meaningless.

                    <h4 class="section2text" valign="middle">
                        As a surveyor, Leung has been dealing with huge pressure under an intensive working environment where everything is pressing and rushed. Before moving to her current company, she used to work overtime frequently and literally lose her personal time, considering the travelling time already took her three hours every day.

                        “That period was quite sad. The situation lasted for six months that I needed to work until early in the morning and start work again at around 9 am” she recalled the tough time before she quit.

                        Leaving the labour market and focusing on housework can be an option but families like the Yeungs will prefer to keep their jobs until retirement because the cost of forgoing a position can be considerable and make them strapped especially when there is no gap between the incomes of two people.

                    <h4 class="section2text" valign="middle">
                        There is a traditional thinking - rearing children to 100 years old concerns parents for 99 years which means taking care of the young is a life-long duty, the additional pressure discourages adults to take up the responsibility, instead, they are eager for freedom of enjoying life that 56.1 per cent of interviewees in the HKWDA survey agreed with.

                        “It (Bearing a child) is just like an abyss without destination,” said Leung. And she was told by a parent of three children “Don’t give birth.”

                        Apart from the financial support parents may need to offer to help start a home, Gennie Leung particularly pointed out the extra efforts on children’s studies.

                    <h4 class="section2text" valign="middle">
                        Playgroup or preschool education has been popular in recent years. By observing the packed schedules of others’ toddlers, Leung can imagine the mental burden and unhappiness if her child was born while choices are limited in such a competitive environment.

                    <h4 class="section2text" valign="middle">
                        The Yeungs also planned to apply preschool education for their future child so as to avoid losing at the starting line and being disadvantaged because they believe it was helpful for improving the communication ability and performance of their child in interviews.

                        Besides the costs on normal days, the impacts of the pandemic create disincentives for fertility. The Family Planning Association of Hong Kong (FPAHK) specifically attribute the recent plunge in the birth rate to the pandemic since infected pregnant females were at higher risk of suffering from threatening complications. According to the survey from HKWDA, the seriousness of COVID development was indeed an influential factor for more than 70 per cent of respondents.

                        Married since 2017, Rex Yu and his wife had been neutral towards childbirth due to their growing background. But COVID reduced his negligible willingness. Working as a college lecturer, Yu said he had been exhausted for a long time since 2019. He needs to adapt to the new teaching mode and handle the extra workload brought by the pandemic. The tiredness often made him unconsciously flake out on the sofa from 9 pm to 2 am, but he then could not fall asleep again.

But the number was less than one in Taiwan and South Korea, another two places that introduced certain related policies.

                        The latest comprehensive review of Population Policy was traced back to seven years ago when Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor was still the Chief Secretary for Administration.
                    </h4>
                    <h4 class="section2text" valign="middle">
                        The report in 2015 said the declining fertility in Hong Kong was not as pressing as other livelihood issues were and “the public may not agree to spend substantial resources on measures to raise fertility.”
                    </h4>
                    <h4 class="section2text" valign="middle">
                        Au Yeung criticised the above statement as “nonsense”, she believed that population policy was crucial, and the next generation would be the key to maintaining sustainability.
                    </h4>
                    <h4 class="section2text" valign="middle">
                        “Children will be the pillars of society which we will rely on, what will the future be if we do not treat them well, it is actually the responsibility of the government,” the vice chairwoman of HKWDA said.
                    </h4>
                    <h4 class="section2text" valign="middle">
                        The view of “Excessive government intervention may not be appropriate” mentioned in the official report, was once again repeated by the leading figure of Hong Kong – John Lee Ka-chiu in 2021, the year when the total birth rate dropped to less than one.
                    </h4>
                    <h4 class="section2text" valign="middle">
                        Instead of considering direct cash subsidy as effective in the local environment, there were amendments to the family-friendly measures after the report, such as the extension of maternity plus paternity leave and adjustment on child tax allowance.
                    </h4>
                    <h4 class="section2text" valign="middle">
                        Although FPAHK commented that there were definite positive effects thanks to the extension of leaves, such improvements cannot be found in the fertility rate trend. Moreover, the efforts spent on building a family-friendly environment in hopes of encouraging birth giving had been too inconsiderable or nugatory to create incentives for couples.
                    </h4>
                    <h4 class="section2text" valign="middle">
                        Au Yeung said the government was just all mouth and no trousers that she could not see a family-friendly environment was truly developed, inadequacy of child care services and late support towards breastfeeding should not happen in this metropolis.
                    </h4>
                    <h4 class="section2text" valign="middle">
                        “As a local, we definitely hope to have more future generations,” she added. “If we lack local manpower, we then have to rely on the imported labours from mainland China.”
